      Our mission - To create a website that motivate artists to keep creating!

      <h3>
        When we first began this project, we had one thing in mind, stoping
        artistic burnout. It's easy to loose motivation as an artist, and we
        hope that by creating a place where artists can track their progress
        over time, artists will be able to look back on their work and be
        inspired by it.

        This website tracks the userâ€™s daily progress on art projects by
        allowing them to upload a drawing to it every day. The calendar tracks
        your progress over time, and displays the drawings to show progress. The
        Canvas Page allows users to create simple sketches and includes a
        drawing prompt generator.

        Our work so far has utilized knowledge from class of common CSS
        Stylesheets, which we've used to ensure our webpage is visually
        cohesive; display tables in the calendar; IDs for each day the drawings
        can be correctly uploaded to calendar; we've also used a variety of
        input types, including file, text, and button. In JavaScript, we used
        arrays, loops, and if statements. The drawing prompt generator pulls an
        item from two arrays and concatenates them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Expanding on the Web Development course content, we've employed
        window.localstorage for the local storage of calendar data when the page
        is refreshed. This project also involves user-uploaded images, another
        diversion from previous content in this course.
